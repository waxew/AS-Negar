/**
 * GLOBAL, per-album "delete from device after backup" preference.
 *
 * Unlike backup destination selection (which is per-account in `cloud_upload_pref`), removing the
 * local copy is a single decision per local album: an asset must only ever be deleted once it is
 * confirmed backed up to **every** cloud that album targets. Keeping this per-account would risk
 * deleting a file after it reached one cloud but not the others (data loss on fan-out).
 *
 * Absence of a row means "keep local copies" (the safe default).
